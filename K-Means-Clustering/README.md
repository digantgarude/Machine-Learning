# K Means Clustering

- The "Customer.csv" file contains the Credit Spending scores of different people based on their income data, age group and gender.
- You can try diffrent correlations to see how clusters are formed when different categories of data are added together.
- (In this dataset you can change the values of iloc[:,[3,4]] i.e income and spending to iloc[:,[2,4]]) to see correlation between age and spending; or try to integrate all three together by selecting the respective categories.



** This code is a part of very old tutorial that I had found online during my undergrad when I wanted to learn about K Means Clustering.(Coludn't remember the source to cite it.) I've made certain changes and added comments for explanation. **
