There are two python files in this repo.

## Usage:

** This code is a part of very old tutorial that I had found online during my undergrad when I wanted to build my project on Outfit Recommendation System and Skin Tone Shade Extractor Algorithm (Project in Repo). I've only made minor changes and added comments for explanation. **
